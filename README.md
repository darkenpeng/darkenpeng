## About Me
 
I'm the sort of person who really hates manual work and wants to learn about automation.

I'm enthusiastic about organizing people and motivated by their potential.

I believe in using techniques to resolve problems caused by humans.

Please call me they/them.

I cannot fix everything but can make things work although method is weird.

And strive to ADJUST STANDARDS that people made.

That's why I keep studying.

I want to be a coder who writes better code, not only performance but readability.
